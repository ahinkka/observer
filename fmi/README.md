# FMI product download and distribution generation

This directory is a holder for two subdirectories.

The first subirectory is `downloader` which literally downloads TIFFs and
creates accompanying metadata .json-files.

The second one is `dist_builder` which builds a data distribution ready to be
deployed alongside the JavaScript app.
